# Azure SQL Managed Instance Deployment

This repository contains Bicep templates to deploy an Azure SQL Managed Instance with associated resources for database security simulations.

## Resources Created

1. **Resource Group**: `rg-d4sql-sims`
2. **Azure SQL Managed Instance**: with unique name suffix
3. **Log Analytics Workspace**: `law-d4sqlsim`
4. **Virtual Network**: `vnet-d4sqlsim` with dedicated subnet
5. **Network Security Group**: configured for SQL MI requirements
6. **Route Table**: for proper network routing
7. **Diagnostic Settings**: sending all SQL MI logs to Log Analytics

## Security Configuration

- **Authentication**: SQL Server authentication with username `d4sqlsim`
- **Network Access**: Restricted to your current public IP address (dynamically retrieved during deployment)
- **Firewall**: Configured to allow only your IP on port 3342 (public endpoint)
- **TLS**: Minimum TLS version 1.2
- **Public Endpoint**: Enabled for external connectivity

## Files

- `main.bicep`: Main Bicep template
- `main.parameters.json`: Parameter file with default values
- `deploy.sh`: Deployment script
- `audit-security.sh`: Security audit script to verify no hardcoded sensitive data
- `SecurityTests/`: Security testing scripts for validating Defender for Database
- `README.md`: This documentation

## Environment Variables

This project follows security best practices by avoiding hardcoded sensitive data:

- **Subscription ID**: Automatically detected from Azure CLI or set via `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`
- **Passwords**: Stored only in `main.parameters.json` (excluded from version control in public repos)
- **Public IP**: Dynamically retrieved during deployment

### Optional Environment Variables

```bash
export AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID="your-subscription-id"  # If not using default Azure CLI subscription
```

## Prerequisites

1. Azure CLI installed and configured
2. Appropriate permissions in the target subscription
3. Bicep CLI (automatically installed with Azure CLI)

## Development Environment Setup

This project includes a `shell.nix` file for easy setup of the development environment using the Nix package manager. This provides reproducible environments across different platforms.

### Option 1: Using Nix (Recommended for Development)

The `shell.nix` file automatically installs all required dependencies:
- `jq` - JSON processor for Azure CLI output parsing
- `nmap` - Network security scanner for security testing
- `sqlcmd` - Microsoft SQL Server command-line tools

#### Installing Nix

**Linux (including WSL):**
```bash
# Install Nix using the official installer (multi-user installation)
curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh -s -- --daemon

# Source the profile
. /etc/profile

# Or single-user installation (if you prefer)
curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh
. ~/.nix-profile/etc/profile.d/nix.sh
```

**macOS:**
```bash
# Install Nix using the official installer
curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh

# Source the profile
. ~/.nix-profile/etc/profile.d/nix.sh

# Or install via Homebrew (alternative)
# brew install nix
```

**Windows (WSL):**
```bash
# First, ensure you have WSL 2 installed
# Install Ubuntu or your preferred Linux distribution from Microsoft Store

# Then follow the Linux installation steps above
curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh -s -- --daemon
. /etc/profile
```

#### Using the Development Environment

Once Nix is installed, navigate to the project directory and enter the development shell:

```bash
# Enter the development environment with all dependencies
nix-shell

# You should see a message confirming the loaded tools:
# Development environment loaded with:
# - jq: JSON processor
# - nmap: Network security scanner  
# - sqlcmd: Microsoft SQL Server
```

The development shell will automatically have all required tools available. Exit the shell with `exit` when done.

#### Benefits of Using Nix

- **Reproducible Environments**: Identical tool versions across all platforms
- **No System Pollution**: Dependencies are isolated and don't affect your system
- **Easy Cleanup**: Simply exit the shell to return to your normal environment
- **Automatic Updates**: Dependencies are managed declaratively
- **Cross-Platform**: Works consistently on Linux, macOS, and Windows (WSL)

### Option 2: Manual Installation

If you prefer not to use Nix, install the dependencies manually:

**Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):**
```bash
# Update package list
sudo apt update

# Install dependencies
sudo apt install -y jq nmap

# Install SQL Server command-line tools
curl https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | sudo apt-key add -
curl https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/20.04/prod.list | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/msprod.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y mssql-tools unixodbc-dev

# Add to PATH
echo 'export PATH="$PATH:/opt/mssql-tools/bin"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

**macOS:**
```bash
# Install Homebrew if not already installed
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# Install dependencies
brew install jq nmap

# Install SQL Server command-line tools
brew tap microsoft/mssql-release https://github.com/Microsoft/homebrew-mssql-release
brew install mssql-tools
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
# Install Chocolatey if not already installed
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))

# Install dependencies
choco install -y jq nmap

# Install SQL Server command-line tools
# Download and install from: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/tools/sqlcmd-utility
```

### Verification

After installation (either method), verify the tools are available:

```bash
# Check tool versions
jq --version
nmap --version
sqlcmd -?

# Test Azure CLI integration
az --version
```

## Deployment

### Option 1: Using the Deployment Script (Recommended)

The deployment script provides a complete end-to-end deployment with interactive setup:

```bash
./deploy.sh
```

**Interactive Setup (if main.parameters.json doesn't exist):**
1. üîê **Password Creation**
   - Prompts for SQL admin password with complexity requirements
   - Validates password meets Azure SQL MI security requirements
   - Requirements: 12+ chars, upper/lower case, digits, special chars
   - Excludes: quotes, backslashes, 'admin', 'sql'

2. üåç **Region Selection**
   - Choose from 9 US Azure regions
   - Options include East US, West US 2, Central US, etc.

**What it does:**
1. ‚úÖ Creates `main.parameters.json` interactively if missing
2. ‚úÖ Deploys all Azure infrastructure (SQL MI, VNet, NSG, etc.)
3. ‚úÖ Automatically detects your public IP for firewall rules
4. ‚úÖ Validates deployment success
5. ‚úÖ **Automatically creates sensitive test data** if deployment succeeds
6. ‚úÖ Provides next steps for security testing

**Expected output on success:**
- Infrastructure deployed
- Sensitive test data created in SQL MI
- Ready for Defender for SQL testing

**Duration:** 3-6 hours (SQL MI provisioning time)

**Test Mode:**
```bash
# Test parameter creation without deploying
./deploy.sh --test-params
```

### Option 2: Manual Deployment

1. **Login to Azure**:
   ```bash
   az login
   # The deployment script will automatically use your current subscription
   # Or set a specific one:
   # az account set --subscription "YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_ID"
   ```

2. **Create Resource Group**:
   ```bash
   az group create --name "rg-d4sql-sims" --location "East US 2"
   ```

3. **Deploy Template**:
   ```bash
   # Get your current public IP first
   PUBLIC_IP=$(curl -s ifconfig.me)
   
   az deployment group create \
     --resource-group "rg-d4sql-sims" \
     --template-file "main.bicep" \
     --parameters "@main.parameters.json" clientPublicIP="$PUBLIC_IP"
   ```

## Connection Details

After deployment completes:

- **Server**: Use the public endpoint FQDN: `<mi-name>.public.<dns-zone>.database.windows.net`
- **Username**: `d4sqlsim`
- **Password**: `YourPassword`
- **Port**: `3342` (public endpoint port)

## Important Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Deployment Time**: SQL Managed Instance deployment typically takes 3-6 hours to complete.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Cost**: Even with cost optimizations (4 vCores, BasePrice licensing, local backup redundancy), SQL Managed Instance costs ~$350-400/month. Monitor your usage and consider alternatives if budget is a concern.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Dynamic IP**: The deployment script automatically detects and uses your current public IP address. The firewall rules will be configured for the IP address you have when running the deployment on **port 3342** (public endpoint).

## Dynamic IP Configuration

The deployment automatically detects and uses your current public IP address:

- **Automatic Detection**: Uses `curl -s ifconfig.me` with fallback to `ipinfo.io/ip`
- **Error Handling**: Deployment fails if IP cannot be detected
- **Flexibility**: Works from any location without code changes
- **Security**: Ensures only your current IP can access the SQL Managed Instance

If you need to update the IP address after deployment (e.g., if you change networks), you can either:
1. Redeploy the template (recommended)
2. Manually update the Network Security Group rules in the Azure Portal

## Monitoring

- All diagnostic logs are automatically sent to the Log Analytics Workspace
- Available log categories include:
  - Resource usage stats
  - Database wait statistics
  - SQL insights
  - Query store runtime statistics
  - Query store wait statistics
  - Errors
  - Database wait statistics

## Security Best Practices

This project follows security best practices:

### Sensitive Data Management
- **Passwords**: Only stored in `main.parameters.json` with secure parameter annotation
- **Subscription IDs**: Automatically detected or sourced from environment variables
- **No Hardcoded Secrets**: All scripts use parameters or environment variables
- **Version Control**: The `.gitignore` excludes sensitive files but includes `main.parameters.json` for template completeness

### Parameter File Security
- `main.parameters.json` contains sample/default values for template completeness
- **For production**: Create a separate private parameter file or use Azure Key Vault
- **For public repos**: Add `main.parameters.json` to `.gitignore` to prevent exposing actual credentials
- **Current setup**: Included for development/testing with sample values

### Network Security
- Public endpoint enabled for external connectivity
- NSG rules restrict access to your public IP only
- TLS 1.2 minimum required
- Network isolation through dedicated subnet

## Cost Management & Optimization

This template is configured for reliable SQL Managed Instance deployment suitable for testing and security simulations. Here's the cost breakdown and optimization options:

### Configuration Choices

- **Compute**: 4 vCores (standard configuration) for reliable performance
  - Provides good balance between cost and performance
  - Sufficient for testing, development, and security simulations with multiple concurrent connections
  
- **License Type**: `BasePrice` instead of `LicenseIncluded`
  - Allows use of Azure Hybrid Benefit if you have existing SQL Server licenses
  - Can provide significant savings (up to 55%) if you have qualifying licenses
  - Even without existing licenses, often still more cost-effective than LicenseIncluded
  
- **Storage**: 32GB (minimum required)
  - Smallest storage allocation available
  - Can be increased later if needed
  
- **Backup Redundancy**: Local instead of Geo-redundant
  - Reduces backup storage costs by ~30-40%
  - Provides protection within the same Azure region
  - Suitable for non-production workloads

### Estimated Monthly Costs

Based on East US pricing (as of 2025):
- **Compute**: ~$350-400/month (4 vCores, BasePrice licensing)
- **Storage**: ~$4/month (32GB)
- **Backup**: ~$1-2/month (local redundancy)
- **Total**: ~$355-405/month

> **Note**: Actual costs may vary based on region, usage patterns, and current Azure pricing. Always check the Azure Pricing Calculator for current estimates.

### Further Cost Reduction Options

If costs are still too high for your use case, consider these alternatives:

1. **Reduce to 2 vCores**: Modify `main.bicep` to use 2 vCores instead of 4
   - Change `vCores: 4` to `vCores: 2` and `capacity: 4` to `capacity: 2`
   - Reduces costs to ~$180-220/month but may impact performance with concurrent connections

2. **Azure SQL Database**: Much cheaper than Managed Instance
   - Single database: ~$15-50/month for testing workloads
   - Elastic pools: ~$20-100/month for multiple databases

3. **SQL Server on VM**: More control over sizing and costs
   - B-series VMs: ~$30-100/month for development/testing
   - Can pause/stop when not in use

4. **Development/Test Pricing**: Special pricing if you have Dev/Test subscriptions
   - Up to 55% savings on compute costs
   - Available with Visual Studio subscriptions

### Monitoring Costs

- **Azure Cost Management**: Monitor spending and set up cost alerts
  - Set budget alerts at $300, $350, and $400 monthly thresholds
  - Review daily costs to catch unexpected spikes early

- **Billing Alerts**: Configure notifications for different spending levels
  - Warning at 80% of budget (~$280/month)
  - Critical at 100% of budget (~$350/month)

- **Cost Optimization Tips**:
  - **Stop during off-hours**: Use automation to pause/start SQL MI if supported
  - **Right-size storage**: Monitor storage usage and adjust as needed
  - **Azure Reservations**: 1-3 year commitments can save 20-60%
  - **Azure Hybrid Benefit**: Use existing SQL Server licenses for additional savings

## Cleanup

To remove all resources:

```bash
az group delete --name "rg-d4sql-sims" --yes --no-wait
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Insufficient Permissions**: Ensure you have Contributor role on the subscription
2. **IP Detection Failure**: If the script cannot detect your public IP, check your internet connection
3. **IP Address Changes**: If your IP changes after deployment, you'll need to update the NSG rules manually or redeploy
4. **Deployment Timeout**: SQL MI deployments can take several hours - this is normal

### Checking Deployment Status

```bash
az deployment group list --resource-group "rg-d4sql-sims" --query "[0].{Name:name, State:properties.provisioningState, Timestamp:properties.timestamp}"
```

## Support

For issues with the deployment, check:
1. Azure Activity Log in the portal
2. Deployment details in the resource group
3. Network connectivity from your IP address

## Security Testing

After deployment, you can validate Defender for Database protection using the included security testing scripts:

### Quick Start
```bash
cd SecurityTests

# Auto-discover and run interactive testing (recommended)
./test-defender-sql-alerts.sh --auto-discover --menu

# Or manually specify host (use public endpoint format and port 3342)
./test-defender-sql-alerts.sh --host your-sql-mi.public.dns-zone.database.windows.net --port 3342

# Quick command line test with auto-discovery
./test-defender-sql-alerts.sh --host [YOUR-SQL-MI-FQDN] --test password-brute

# Comprehensive testing (all tests) 
# Note: Use the public endpoint FQDN format: <mi-name>.public.<dns-zone>.database.windows.net
./test-defender-sql-alerts.sh --host [YOUR-SQL-MI-FQDN] --username d4sqlsim --password [YOUR-PASSWORD] --batch
```

### Test Options
- **Interactive Mode**: Menu-driven testing with guided configuration
- **Password Brute Force**: Tests password attacks on known usernames (3 wordlist sizes)
- **Username Enumeration**: Tests discovery of valid usernames (3 wordlist sizes)  
- **Comprehensive Brute Force**: Combined password and username attacks
- **SQL Injection Testing**: Vulnerability detection and attack simulation
- **Advanced Security Tests**: Harmful applications, suspicious queries, enumeration, shell commands
- **Batch Mode**: Run all tests automatically with comprehensive reporting
- **Stealth Mode**: Configurable delays and threading for realistic attack patterns

### Expected Alerts
The tests should trigger Defender for Database alerts in Azure Security Center:
- Brute force login attempts (both password and username attacks)
- Suspicious authentication patterns
- SQL injection attempts and vulnerabilities
- Harmful application detection
- Service enumeration activities
- Multiple failed login attempts
- Anomalous database access patterns

See `SecurityTests/README.md` for detailed testing instructions and methodology.

### Security Audit

Run the included security audit script to verify no sensitive data is hardcoded:

```bash
./audit-security.sh
```

This script checks for:
- Hardcoded subscription IDs outside parameter files
- Hardcoded connection strings in code
- Proper .gitignore configuration
- Hardcoded passwords in scripts
